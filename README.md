# Criminal Detector

Criminal Detector app helps you unmask criminals trying to hide their real identity from you. The app helps you figure out if the person you are interacting with is faking
about his identity or hiding about crucial details of their past from you.<br>

# How does it all work ?

The app is divided into two parts the admin side and the normal user side.<br><br>
<strong>General User</strong> :- The general user can directly use the "Continue to app" button and they will be redirected to the home page where they can use the 
"Scan" button to scan the face of that person who is suspecious to them. If the face of that person will be present in the db all the appropiate details will be displayed
otherwise "Person has no criminal history" will be shown.<br>

<strong>Admin</strong> :- The admin side can only be accessed by legal authoroties which will be incharge of adding criminal details into the database. Normal users can't access the admin panel as when you click on it, it asks you for admin username and password. In the admin side there are two options scan and add. Scan will serve the similar purpose it did in the general user side but with add the admin can scan for new faces which he wants to add in the db and fill in all the additional details along with the face data to insert it into the database.<br>
